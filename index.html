                        <p><a href="about">As a child growing up in Wat-Tham-Krabok, Thailand, I learned how to draw. One artist that influenced me was my dad. He was and still one of the best artist I know. My dad started painting when he was in Laos. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, my dad escaped from Laos and immigrated to Thailand, which was where my dad began to really concentrating on his painting. In Ban Vinai, Thailand, was a refugee camp for the Hmong people and life was always hard in there. As a father, my dad needed to do something to support the family so he decided to paint heavily. He liked to paint nature and landscape; they were mostly based on Laos’s land structures. My dad’s main focus was realism art... </a></p>
