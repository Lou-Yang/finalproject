                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>As a child growing up in Wat-Tham-Krabok, Thailand, I learned how to draw. One artist that influenced me was my dad. He was and still one of the best artist I know.</p>

                        <p>My dad started painting when he was in Laos. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, my dad escaped from Laos and immigrated to Thailand, which was where my dad began to really concentrating on his painting. In Ban Vinai, Thailand, was a refugee camp for the Hmong people and life was always hard in there. As a father, my dad needed to do something to support the family so he decided to paint heavily. He liked to paint nature and landscape; they were mostly based on Laos’s land structures. My dad’s main focus was realism art. </p>

                        <p>On a daily basis, my dad would painted a 15ft high and 20ft long canvas. The reason why he needed to paint this big was to make money. Every year during the Hmong New Year celebration, people would came to take picture with my dad’s paintings and they would paid him. Each photo taken cost about 10 baht, which is about $0.33 in US. Some of the Hmong businessmen from America would also came and bought my dad’s paintings for about $5,000 baht, which is about $166.66 dollars in today. Just by looking at how talented my dad is, I kept thinking to myself that I must be like him one day. I wanted to be able to use my own creative skills to support my family. One thing from my dad’s artwork that inspired me was painting with memorization. He would painted Laos’s land structures with the only memory he had when he was still in Laos. As a child, I didn’t know anything about my dad’s paintings beside that they were beautiful. But as I grew up, I learned that his arts were very emotional. Like my dad, I like to tell stories through my paintings. I wanted my audiences to know the stories of my childhood life and also my culture. Unlike my dad, my paintings were focusing on the abstractism of feelings. As I painted, I liked to show my feelings for the audiences to see when they look at my work. </p>

                        <p>In my opinion, feeling is the most important thing when it comes to art. You needed your audiences to see not just the beauty of the painting itself, but also the feeling that you put into it. </p>
